1. Standarlize the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class "template" method

3. Steps requiring peculiar implementations are "placeholders" in base class
4. Derived classes can override placeholder methods
5. Derived classes can override implemented methods
6. Derived classes can override and "call back to" base class methods
